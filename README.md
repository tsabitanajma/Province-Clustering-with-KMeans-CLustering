# Province Clustering by Stunting Factor with KMeans CLustering

## About Dataset
The dataset contains factors contributing to stunting by province in Indonesia. The variables are as follows:
* X1: percentage of households with access to improved sanitation,
* X2: percentage of antenatal care service coverage for pregnant women,
* X3: percentage of infants receiving complete basic immunization,
* X4: percentage of infants under six months of age who are exclusively breastfed.

## Conclusion
1. Based on the silhouette values, the highest average silhouette was obtained with three clusters, indicating that the optimal number of clusters is three.
2. The analysis resulted in three clusters of provinces in Indonesia based on stunting-related factors, with Cluster 1 consisting of 10 provinces, Cluster 2 consisting of 16 provinces, and Cluster 3 consisting of 8 provinces.
3. The evaluation yielded average silhouette scores of 0.30 for Cluster 1, 0.29 for Cluster 2, and 0.15 for Cluster 3. These results suggest that Clusters 1 and 2 are fairly acceptable but not ideal, while Cluster 3 shows relatively poor clustering quality.
